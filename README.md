**#additional features**

In the project, the user can use the left and right key to control the elephant to eat the apples and earn scores. When the elephant touches the red apple, the apple disappears and a new apple is fromed randomly at the top of the screen. The elephant will also make a sound. The score increases by 1 evey time a red apple is eaten and increase the difficulty level by 1 for every 5 scores earned. The speed of the apple dropping will increase while the level increasing. If the elephant fails to eat the red apple and it falls to the bottom, the game is over. 

There are also green apples that have the same speed as the red apple. If the elephant eats the green apple, the game is over.
